# H1B Visa Data Analysis
 H1-B visas are a type of non-immigrant visa for foreign national professionals who wish to work in the United States. As of FY 2022, there were around 308,613 H-1B registrations from 37,000 prospective petitioners. The visa requires the applicant to have an employment letter which indicates their legal employment in order to file an application to the US immigration service (USCIS). The number of applications approved by USCIS yearly should not exceed 85000 but the non-immigrants who wish to work in United States are outnumbered recently. The selection of the visa process is based on lottery; hence, it is crucial to understand the case status movements from the past years and to analyze which all factors thus affecting the approval of the visa. In this project, we have performed various exploratory data analysis to understand the trends and variation of H1-B visa application certification to help both the employee and the employer.
